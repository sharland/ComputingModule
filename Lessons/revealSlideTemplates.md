#Reveal.JS slide templates

In order to quickly work with reveal.js in creating HTML slide-decks you will need to be familiar with HTML firstly but in order to make it as simple as possible I have included below some HTML slide templates.  All you will need to do is within the `<div class="slides">` section copy in one of the following slide templates including all the tags and example content and then replace the content with your own.

- Title Slide
- Simple slide

##Title Slide
